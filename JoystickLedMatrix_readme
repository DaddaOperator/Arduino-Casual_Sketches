This project involves the use of a joystick. Depending on the movement of the controller,
a corresponding LED configuration will light up on an 8x8 LED matrix (see hardware information)
and one of the 4 LEDs arranged in a cross corresponding to the direction of the joystick will light up.
When the joystick button is pressed, the 4 leds arranged in a cross will light up simultaneously 
for a fraction of a second.

The circuit also provides, thanks to the presence of a photoresistor, that other 3 additional LEDs
light up when the detected brightness drops below a predefined threshold level, however this feature 
has nothing to do with the joystick functions but they are only an additional implementation on the same circuit.

For more informations you can read the comments on the sketch file.

For the circuit realization I am using an arduino mega with the various components described above and 
I will soon upload a file with the diagram relating to the electrical connections with all the details.
