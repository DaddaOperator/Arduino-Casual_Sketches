In this mini project it is possible to control a stepper motor through an infrared remote control, 
remaining monitored on the current status of the system through an LCD display and a red LED.
The stepper motor can be connected to any secondary device that needs the mechanical power of the motor.
For more informations you can read the comments on the sketch file.

For the circuit realization I am using an arduino mega with the various components described above and 
I will soon upload a file with the diagram relating to the electrical connections with all the details.
